Instance files used in the manuscript *On the approximation of separable non-convex optimization programs to an arbitrary numerical tolerance* by Claudio Contardo and Sandra U. Ngueveu, to appear at the **INFORMS Journal on Computing**.
This folder contains four subfolders, as follows:

- **cMCND_Instances**: Dataset containg instances of the congested multi-commodity network design problem (cMCNDP), generated and introduced by [Paraskevopoulos, Gürel, and Bektas (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1366554515001921). These instances have also been used for benchmarking in [Codsi, Ngueveu, and Gendron (2025)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12532-024-00274-8). This dataset can alternatively be found in [this github repository](https://github.com/LICO-labs/cMCND-Computational-Results/tree/master/Data).
- **knap**: Instances for the continuous nonlinear knapsack problem (CNLKP), geneated by us, following the generator described in [Trindade, d'Ambrosio, Frangione (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167637723001803). In our code you will find the generator in the function `write_knapsack_trindade(n, s, k)`, where `n` is the number of items, `s` the name of the output file, and `k` the number id of the instance.
- **transportation**: Instances for the nonlinear transportation problem (NLTP). These instances have been generated by us using the method `generate_random_transp(m, n)` where `m` is the number of potential facilities, and `n` the number of customers.
- **uflp**: Dataset for the uncapacitated nonlinear facility location problem (UNFLP). Inside this you will find three subfolders with different classes of instances, as follows:
    - **gunluk**: Dataset generated according to the description found in [Günluk and Linderoth (2010)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-010-0360-z). The instance generator is in the method `generate_gunluk_uflp(m, n, seed)` where `m` is the number of potential facilities, `n` the number of customers, and `seed` a non-negative integer (the seed) for the pseudo-random number generator.
    - **holmberg**: Dataset containg 71 instances from the article [Holmber, Ronnqvist, and Yuan (1999)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221798000083).
    - **orlib**: Dataset containing 40 instances from [Beasley (1990)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2582903).
